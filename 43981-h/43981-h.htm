<h2>OPERATIC NOTES.</h2>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Tannhäuserites disappointed. Signor <span class="sc">Vignas</span> indisposed.
<i>Tannhäuser's</i> understudy <i>Faust</i> put up. House good.
Performance better. <span class="sc">Plançon</span>,&mdash;once <i>Jupiter</i> now
<i>Mephistopheles</i>,
the extremes meeting in one singer,&mdash;excellent. <span class="sc">Melba</span> quite the
German Fräulein. <span class="sc">Bevignani</span>, C. B.,
<i>i.e.</i>, "Conducting Beautifully," in
the chair.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Many other attractions,
yet heart is true to Opera. <span class="sc">M. Victor
Maurel</span>, as <i>Iago</i>, adds another leaf
to his victor's wreath of Laurel.
<span class="sc">Maggie Macintyre</span> makes distinct
advance, and sings, "O Willow, we
have missed you" most melodiously.
<span class="sc">Tam Agno</span> as <i>Misther O'Tello</i>, the
Irish darky singer, uncommonly
powerful. <span class="sc">Richard Green</span>, <i>Montano</i>,
greener than ever: quite fresh.
<span class="sc">Percy Mordy</span> a good <i>Roderigo Randomo</i>.
The highly Pole-ish'd <span class="sc">Olitzka</span>
a fair representative of <i>Emilia</i>. And
this cast, with Merry <span class="sc">Mancinelli</span>
manipulating musicians, makes the
Opera a delight to the <i>fine fleur</i> of
the Covent Gardenian Hot House.</p>

<p class="center">Pagliacci.</p></div>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;House crammed to
see and hear <span class="sc">Adelina Patti</span> as <i>Rosina</i>
in the ever delightful <i>Barbiere di
Siviglia</i>. <span class="sc">Rossini</span> for ever! "Whar's
your <span class="sc">Wullie Wagner</span> noo?" <span class="sc">Patti's</span> acting worth a third of the
money; her singing makes up t'other two-thirds. "Bonus" to
audience in "<i>Home, Sweet Home</i>." Wrapt attention! Here we are
all of us out for the night, so to speak, in silks and satins and jewels
rare, and with feathers and diamonds and all our war paint on, off
afterwards to routs, balls and supper-parties, and yet all hushed,
conscience-stricken as it were, in the midst of our gaiety, by sweet
voice warbling so distinctly "Home! Home! Home! Sweet Home!
Wherever (including the Opera Covent Garden) we wander (and we
can't wander when our attention is riveted on <i>la Diva</i>) there is
no-oh-o-o place like Ho-ome!" And then, second verse finished, a
storm of rapturous applause bursts over the singer! Yes! those are
our sentiments. "Home! Home!" by all means. Only&mdash;excuse us&mdash;we
"<i>won't</i> go Home Sweet Home till morning, till daylight doth appear."
But why, <span class="sc">Adelina</span> <i>mia</i>, didst thou sing at the end of the Opera
that remarkably anti-climaxious waltz of <span class="sc">Ti-to-tum Mattei's</span>?
<span class="sc">Ti-to-tum</span>
all very well in his way, but not a <span class="sc">Rossini</span>. And then you
sang it from a paper in your hand as though doing penance in a music
sheet? A mistake, <span class="sc">Adelina</span>, don't do it again, spin your
<span class="sc">Ti-to-tum</span>
at a concert, but not in <span class="sc">Rossini's</span> <i>Barbiere</i>. <span class="sc">Bertha
Bauermeister</span>
obtained a rapturous encore, but shook her finger at the audience as
who would say "too late! too late!" So <span class="sc">Bevignani</span> bowed, and on we
went again merrily. <span class="sc">Pini-Corsi</span> good as pantaloon <i>Bartolo</i>.
<span class="sc">Ancona</span>
a capital <i>Figaro</i>, looking like one of <i>Cruikshank's</i> comic
characters.
<span class="sc">'Abry Mundy</span>, fine <i>Basilio</i> done in Italian oils; <span class="sc">M.
Bonnard</span>, light and
airy French count, more of larker than lover. All Home-Sweet-Home-ing
(or elsewhere) about midnight, many being detained by the singers
at the Opera from getting to the <span class="sc">Speaker's</span> "at Home," Sweet Home.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;<i>Pagliacci</i>, with Miss <span class="sc">Pauline Joran</span> appearing
as <i>Nedda</i>, and playing it in first-rate style. "Gee up! <i>Nedda!</i>"
<i>Query.</i> <span class="sc">Pini-Corsi</span> good as <i>Tonio</i>? <i>Answer.</i>
<span class="sc">'Corsi</span> was. T'others
not much, but Opera still charming. Yet this evening's programme
too trying for emotional persons. <i>Pagliacci</i>, tragedy; <i>Cavalleria
Rusticana</i> tragedy also; tragedy from beginning to end; even the
celebrated <i>mezzo</i> very like a wail! Not kind of <span class="sc">Druriolanus</span> to
afflict us thus. Madame <span class="sc">Bellincioni</span>, "the original <i>Santuzza</i>,"
admirable. Honours easy between Madame <span class="sc">Calvé</span> and <span class="sc">Bellincioni</span>.
The latter played it first abroad; but the former had the start of her
<i>here</i>. In some of the action peculiarly characteristic of the type,
<span class="sc">Bellincioni</span> wins, not by a neck, but by two hands. <span class="sc">Calvé</span> more
striking (hands down) in her jealous agony. Signor <span class="sc">Valentine
Figaro Ancona</span> excellent as <i>Alfio</i>; the situation when
<span class="sc">Vignas</span>,
going strong as <i>Turiddu</i>, catches <i>Alfio's</i> ear, in order, as he says
in
Sicilian, "Tu-rid-u of his presence" by subsequently killing him,
more dramatic than ever. <span class="sc">Giulia Ravogli</span> admirable as quite the
gay <i>Lola</i> of the Sicilian Seven Dials. After <i>intermezzo</i> Bowing
<span class="sc">Bevignani</span> declines <i>encore</i>.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Child <i>Harold</i> allowed to sit up late for another night.
Composer <span class="sc">Cowen</span> ought to sing, "I love my <span class="sc">Albani</span> with an A,
because
she's Admirable." <i>Harold</i> improveth on representation. <i>William
Malet</i> played by <span class="sc">Richard Green</span>. Nice of the librettist, Sir
<span class="sc">Edward Malet</span>, to keep the memory of his ancestor Green. It must
make singers rather nervous to have the composer <i>vis-à-vis</i> conducting
his own work; as <span class="sc">Wagstaff</span> observes, "in this instance it
must have the effect of Cowin' them." 'Nother week gone.</p>

<h2>A SIESTA.</h2>

<p>How sleepy I feel! It is this beastly influenza cold and headache.
The best thing to do for a headache is to have a little doze and sleep
it off. Not a very easy thing to do in a big Paris hotel in the afternoon.
However, it is quiet enough in my room, looking on to the
courtyard, away from the noises of the Boulevard.</p>

<p>Just dropping off. Crash! Only someone shutting a door. That
is not an unusual sound. In these big hotels no one closes a door, no
one glides along a passage, no one speaks in a soft voice, but everyone
bangs, and stamps, and shouts. If it is a woman, she screams.
Another crash! The man in the next room just come in. That's
the Frenchman with the awful cough. No one but a Frenchman
could have a cough like that. Lie and listen to his cough for some
time. Various other doors banged. But at last sink into unconsciousness.
Good Heavens! What's happened now? Oh, it's the
American trunks being dragged out of the room on the other side.
Well, at any rate I shall not hear the American voices now through
that miserable door of communication, which, locked and bolted ever
so carefully, does not keep out sounds. But there is someone talking
there now. Of course the new comers. It must be two people. No,
twenty people. By Jove, they are Germans! And there's the
Frenchman's cough again. I shall never get to sleep. Yet somehow
the sounds get confused, I fancy the Germans are coughing and the
Frenchman is saying "<i>Ja, ja, ja,</i>" and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>There, now I am awake again. Why, there's someone knocking
at the door. "<i>Pardon, monsieur, avez-vous reçu votre linge?</i>"
"<i>Mais, oui, je l'ai reçu hier.</i>" "<i>Pardon, monsieur, il y a des
faux-cols.</i>"
"<i>Non, je les ai reçus tous.</i>" "<i>Mais, monsieur&mdash;&mdash;</i>" "<i>Mais
qu'est-ce que vous me chantez là? Laissez-moi tranquille.</i>" "<i>Mais,
monsieur, le monsieur en face m'a dit que monsieur a reçu des
faux-cols que monsieur&mdash;&mdash;</i>" Confound the collars! Get up,
let in the <i>garçon</i>, examine my collars and the collars of the <i>monsieur
en face</i>, who is just packing up, rectify the mistake of the washerwoman,
and am again alone. Now is it worth going to sleep or not?
Will try once more.</p>

<p>What's that? "<span class="sc">Marie!</span>" It's someone shouting outside my
door. How fond they are of shouting outside my door! "<span class="sc">Marie!</span>
<i>De l'eau chaude.</i>" I hope she won't think it's for me, or she'll
wake me up if at last I get a chance of dropping off. Then silence.
Positively, absolute silence. The coughing Frenchman must have
been suffocated; the Germans&mdash;no, nothing could stop the Germans
from talking, only they have gone out of hearing. And the <i>femme
de chambre</i> has hurried off to fetch that hot water for somebody, and
the <i>garçon</i> is not banging his broom about in this <i>couloir</i>, and
there
is no baggage coming or going, and no door crashing; and, in the
midst of profound peace, I think drowsily of quiet country afternoons,
when one hears only the humming of the bees, and the
whispering of the aspens, and then, and then&mdash;&mdash;Hullo! What's
up now? There's someone else knocking. My last chance gone.
My head is aching more than ever. "<i>Eh bien?</i>" "<i>C'est l'eau
chaude que vous avez commandée, Monsieur.</i>"</p>

<h2>SOCIETY'S NEXT CRAZE.</h2>

<p class="title1">(<i>As foreseen by Mr. Punch's Second-sighted Clairvoyant.</i>)</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="outdent"><i>It is the summer</i></span> <i>of 1896&mdash;or possibly '97.
The scene is a road skirting Victoria Park, Bethnal Green, which Society's
leaders have recently discovered and appointed as the</i> rendez-vous <i>for
the Season, and where it is now the correct thing for all really
smart people to indulge, between certain prescribed hours, in
sports and pastimes that have hitherto been more characteristic
of the masses than the classes. The only permissible mount
now is the donkey, which must be ridden close to the tail, and
referred to as a "moke." A crowd of well-turned-out spectators
arrives from the West End every morning about eleven to watch
the brilliant parade of "Mokestrians" (as the Society journalist
will already have decided to call them). Some drive slowly up
and down on coster-barrows, attended by cockaded and disgusted
grooms. About twelve, they break up into light luncheon
parties; after which they play democratic games for half an
hour or so, and drive home
on drags.</i>

<p><i>Mr. Woodby-Innett</i> (<i>to the</i>
Donkey Proprietor). Kept a
moke for me? I told you I
should be wantin' one every
mornin' now.</p>

<p><i>The Donkey Proprietor</i> (<i>after
consulting engagement-book</i>).
I've not got it down on my list,
Sir. Very sorry, but the Countess
of <span class="sc">Cumberback</span> has just
booked the last for the 'ole of
this week. Might let you 'ave
one by-and-by, if Sir <span class="sc">Hascot
Goodwood</span> brings his in punctual,
but I can't promise it.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Woodby-Inn.</i> That's no
good; no point in ridin' after
the right time. (<i>To himself, as
he turns away.</i>) Nuisance!
Not that I'm so keen about a
moke. Not a patch on a bike!&mdash;though
it don't do to say so.
Only if I'd known this, I'd
have turned up in a tall hat and
frock coat; and then I could
have taken a turn on the steam-circus.
Wonder if it would be
any sort of form shyin' at cocoa-nuts
in tweeds and a straw hat.
Must ask some chap who knows.
More puzzlin' what to put on this
year than ever!</p>

<p><i>Lady Ranela Hurlingham</i>
(<i>breathlessly to</i> Donkey Proprietor).
That's mine, isn't it?
Will you please put me up, and
<i>promise</i> me you'll keep close behind
and make him run. (<i>Suppliantly.</i>)
You will, <i>won't</i> you?</p>

<p><i>The Donkey Proprietor</i> (<i>with
a due sense of his own value</i>).
Well, I dessay I can come along presently, Lady <span class="sc">'Urlingham</span>, and
fetch 'im a whack or two; jest now I can't, having engaged to come and
'old the Marshiness of <span class="sc">'Ammercloth's</span> on <i>'er</i> moke; but there, you
orter be able to git along well enough by yourself now&mdash;<i>you</i> ought!</p>

<p><i>Captain Sonbyrne</i> (<i>just home on leave from India&mdash;to</i> Mrs.
<span class="sc">Chesham-Lowndes</span>). Rather an odd sort of idea this&mdash;I mean,
coming all the way out here to ride a lot of donkeys, eh?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Chesham-Lowndes.</i> It used to be rather amusing a month
ago, before they all got used to riding so near the tail; but now
they're all so good at it, don't you know.</p>

<p><i>Capt. Sonb.</i> I went down to Battersea Park yesterday to see the
bicyclists. Not a soul there, give you my word!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.-L.</i> No; there <i>wouldn't</i> be <i>this</i> season. You see, all
sorts
and conditions of people began to take it up, and it got too fearfully
common. And now moke-riding has quite cut it out.</p>

<p><i>Capt. Sonb.</i> But why ride donkeys when you can get gees?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C.-L.</i> Oh, well, they're democratic, and cheap, and all that,
don't you know. And one really can't be <i>seen</i> on a horse this year&mdash;in
town, at least. In the country it don't matter so much.</p>

<p><i>First Mokestrian</i> (<i>to second ditto</i>). Hullo, old chap, so
<i>you</i>'ve
taken to a moke at last, eh? How are you gettin' on?</p>

<p><i>Second Mokestrian.</i> Pretty well. I can sit on his tail all right
now, but I can't get into the way of keepin' my heels off the ground
yet, it's so beastly difficult.</p>

<p><i>Fragments from Spectators.</i> That's rather a smart barrow, Lady
<span class="sc">Barinrayne's</span> drivin' to-day.... Who's the fellow with her, with
the paper feather in his pot-hat? Bad style, <i>I</i> call it.... That's
Lord <span class="sc">Freddy Fugleman</span>&mdash;best dressed man in London. You'll
see everybody turnin' up in a paper feather in a day or two....
Lot of men seem to be using a short clay as a cigarette-holder now,
don't they?... Yes, <span class="sc">Roddie Rippingill</span> introduced the idea last
week, and it seems to have caught on. [<i>&amp;c., &amp;c.</i>]</p>

<p class="title1"><span class="sc">After Luncheon; at the Steam-Circus, and other Sports.</span></p>

<p><i>Scraps of Small-talk.</i> No end sorry, Lady <span class="sc">Gwendolin</span>; been
tryin' to get you a scent-squirt everywhere; but they're all gone;
such a run on 'em for Ascot, don't you know.... Thanks; it
doesn't matter; only dear Lady <span class="sc">Buckram</span> has just thrown some red
ochre down the back of my neck, and <span class="sc">Algy Vere</span> came and shot out
a coloured paper thing right in my face, and I shouldn't like to
seem uncivil.... Suppose I shall see you at Lady <span class="sc">Brabazon's</span>
"Kiss in the Ring" at Bethnal Green to-morrow afternoon?...
I believe she <i>did</i> send us cards, but we promised to look in at a
friendly lead the Duchess of
<span class="sc">Dillwater</span> is giving at such a
dear little public she's discovered
in Whitechapel, so we may be
rather late.... You'll keep a
handkerchief-throw for me if
you <i>do</i> come on, won't you?...
It will have to be an <i>extra</i>, then,
I'm afraid.... Are you goin' to
Lord <span class="sc">Balmisyde's</span> eight o'clock
breakfast to-morrow? <i>So</i> glad;
I hear he's engaged five coffee-stalls,
and we're all to stand up
and eat saveloys and trotters and
thick bread and butter.... Oh,
I wanted to ask you, my girls
have got an invitation to a
hoky-poky party the <span class="sc">Vavasours</span>
are giving after the moke-ridin'
next Thursday, and I'm told it's
quite wrong to eat hoky-poky
with a spoon&mdash;do you know how
that is?... The only <i>correct</i>
way, <span class="sc">Caroline</span>, is to lick it out
of the glass, which requires practice
before it can be <i>attempted</i> in
public. But I hear there's quite
a pleasant boy-professor somewhere
in the Mile End Road who
teaches it in a single lesson; he's
<i>very</i> moderate; his terms are
only half a guinea, which includes
the hoky-poky. I'll send
you his address if I can find it....
Thanks <i>so</i> much; the dear
girls <i>will</i> be so grateful to you....
I <i>do</i> think it's <i>quite</i> too
bad of Lady <span class="sc">Geraldine Grabber</span>,
she goes and sticks her card
on the only decent wooden horse
in the steam-circus and says she's
engaged it for the whole time,
though she hardly ever takes a
round! And so many girls standing out who can ride without getting
in the <i>least</i> giddy!... Rathah a boundah, that fellow, if you ask me;
I've <i>seen</i> him pullin' a swing boat in brown boots and ridin'-breeches!...
How wonderfully well your daughter throws the rings, dear Lady
<span class="sc">Cornelia</span>, I hear she's won three walking-sticks and five clasp
knives.... You're very kind. She is quite clever at it; but then
she's had some private coaching from a gipsy, don't you know....
What are you going to do with yourself this afternoon?... Oh, I'm
going to the People's Palace to see the finals played off for the Skittles
Championship; bound to be a closish thing; rather excitin', don't you
know.... Ah, Duchess, you've been in form to-day, I see, five
cocoa-nuts! Can I relieve you of some of them?... Thanks, they <i>are</i>
rather tiresome to carry; if you <i>could</i> find my carriage and tell the
footman to keep his eye on them. [<i>&amp;c. &amp;c.</i>].</p>

<p><i>Lady Rosehugh</i> (<i>to</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Luke Walmer</span>, <i>on the way

know I <i>do</i> think it's <i>such</i> a cheering sign of the times, Society
getting simpler in its tastes, and sharing the pleasures of the Dear
People, and all that; it must tend to bring all classes more <i>together</i>,
don't you know!</p>

<h3>SCRAPS FROM CHAPS.</h3>

<p class="ind">Mr. <span class="sc">H. T. Waddy</span>, the Liberal Candidate,
has been telling the voters of the Truro-Helston
division of Cornwall stories about those
wicked publicans. At one of the bye elections
they got out posters, which read, "If you vote
for the Liquor Traffic Bill, this house will be
closed," and displayed them in their premises.
But the Radical humorist was on the warpath,
and, having provided himself with
copies of the poster, attached them to the
respective doors of the prison, the lunatic
asylum, and the workhouse. This was quite
excellent. But Mr. <span class="sc">Waddy</span> might have
carried the joke a little further, say as far as
London. There, at all events, the Bill may
possibly lead to the early closing of one public
house, where business has for some time been
in a very bad way. This would of course be
a source of great satisfaction to Mr. <span class="sc">Waddy</span>&mdash;and
his leaders.</p>

<p class="ind1">In connection with the course of lectures

by gas were put to practical test. Truly there
be epicures at Truro who know what's what.
Cooking by G. A. S. must have been a great

<h2>BUBBLES from the BALTIC.</h2>

<p class="title1"><span class="sc">BLOWN from the PIPE of TOBY. M.P.</span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 440px;"><a href="images/304a-900.png"><img src="images/304a-440.png" width="440" height="484" alt="BUBBLES from the BALTIC." /></a></div>

<p><i>Off the Elbe, Wednesday
Afternoon.</i>&mdash;Got up steam,
weighed anchor and laid our
course East by North half
South for Hamburg. Don
<span class="sc">Currie</span>, whose knowledge of
ocean life is extensive and
peculiar, tells me no well
regulated ship puts to sea
without first ascertaining the
weight of her anchor. Much
interested at this peep into
nautical life. But what has
the weight of the anchor to
do with the voyage of the
<i>Tantallon Castle</i>, or even
with the opening of the
Baltic Canal? Well, the
Don is not sure. Anyhow, it is an old custom. Sailors are superstitious,
and if this preliminary to a voyage were omitted, they
would turn rusty, and might even want to throw someone overboard.
So, to prevent possible unpleasantness, the anchor is weighed&mdash;"To
an ounce," Don <span class="sc">Currie</span> says severely.</p>

<p>Suppose before we turn in we shall be told how much it weighs.
Wish I knew what is the average weight of a really good anchor.
So awkward if a man comes upon you suddenly, and says "The
anchor weighs just over a ton"; or "What do you think? the
anchor turns the scale at fifty-two lbs. ten dwt." Is one too much,
and is the other surprisingly little? Haven't the slightest idea.
Shall, in either case, say "Ha!" That is, at any rate, noncommittal.</p>

<p>Mr. G. will know what an anchor ought to weigh in given circumstances.
He knows everything. Shall try and find opportunity of
asking him.</p>

<p><i>Hamburg, Friday</i>, 5 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>&mdash;"I am very fond of the German
tongue," said the Member for <span class="sc">Sark</span>, paying me an early morning
pyjama-call. "The language in which <span class="sc">Goethe</span> wrote and <span class="sc">Heine</span>
sang is sacred. Still, when it is emitted from the throats of half a
score of steam-whistles, one feels there are limits to passionate
desire. Have often heard siren song of steam-whistle in and about
the Thames. That's bad enough for the sensitive ear. But when it
comes to steam-whistling in German, you begin to understand why
people sometimes commit suicide."</p>

<p>For my part, I like it. Few things more charming than to be
wakened at daybreak by a steam-whistle spluttering in your larboard
ear. Before you have quite drank in the fulness of the music, another
shrieks in your starboard ear. Then, far and near, all round the
harbour, they pop off in different keys. Some angry; some whining;
some in anguishing pain; some mocking; some wailing; one ingenious
contrivance, moved by a master-hand, managing to imitate a
burst of maniacal laughter, in which, if you didn't bury your head
in the pillow, you feel you must join.</p>

<p>Then there's the effect on the man on deck. Don't know who he
is; fancy he must be the Supercargo. At first shriek of the earliest
whistle, he puts on the heaviest boots (those with the clump of steel
at the toes, the wedges of iron at the heel, and fat-headed nails all
over the sole). He gives preliminary stamp precisely over your head;
all right; steam-whistle shrieks; others respond; Supercargo is off;
stamps to and fro just the length of the deck immediately over your
berth; leaps up height of two feet; drops exactly over your head;
steam-whistles go faster; Supercargo clatters off; fetches from
somewhere a plank, a rough-hewn plank studded with nails; this
he dashes on the deck over your head; got the range to a nicety;
never misses; steam-whistles go off simultaneously; maddening
effect on Supercargo; he rages to and fro, charges over your berth,
banging the plank with mad delight. You get out of your berth,
dash to side; just going to plunge over; when Quartermaster seizes
you and leads you back to cabin, locking you in.</p>

<p>And <span class="sc">Sark</span> says he doesn't care for early morning effects in
Hamburg harbour!</p>

<p><i>Saturday Morning.</i>&mdash;Steaming down Elbe, meaning to anchor at its
mouth. (Not at its elbow, as <span class="sc">Sark</span> told the pilot. Pilot didn't see
joke. Stared at him, and said, "<i>Hein?</i>" which made <span class="sc">Sark</span> look
foolish.) Last night citizens of Hamburg entertained us at dinner.
Banquet spread in what they call the Zoologischer Garten. Odd
how the way of pronouncing a familiar word grows upon some people
after dinner.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;"><a href="images/304b-700.png"><img src="images/304b-250.png" width="250" height="477" alt="Mr. Punch regrets to hear...." /></a>
<p><i>Mr. Punch</i> regrets to hear (from a thoroughly [un]reliable
source) that some confusion has been caused at
Keil owing to the great physical resemblance between
his representative on the <i>Tantallon Castle</i> and His
Imperial Majesty the <span class="sc">German Emperor</span>!! In fact,
some doubts are expressed as to which of the two it was
who opened the Baltic Canal!</p></div>

<p>Feeding time seven. No extra charge to the public, who are kept
outside. Excellent dinner; but general arrangement more suited to
time of Methuselah than our shorter-lived day. Sat down at 7.30;
finished by 11.30. Peculiarity of <i>menu</i> was the interpolation of cold
speeches among the hot dishes. As soon as we swallowed
our <i>Klare Schildkrötensuppe</i>, and toyed with our <i>Forellen,
blau mit Butter</i>, Chairman rose and proposed toast to Emperor.
Next came on the table (sideways, of course) <i>Helgoländer hummer
auf amerikanische Art</i>. Before the dish was removed, another
gentleman on his legs proposing health of Mr. G. So on through the
meal: first a bite and sup, then a speech. Practice interesting,
though apt to induce a coolness on part of some of the dishes. Suppose
cook calculates that gentlemen proposing particular toast will
speak for ten minutes; he takes twenty, or, if of a fearless nature,
half an hour. Where's your next dish? Why, cold or burnt. Nor
can system be recommended on score of economy. Consequence of
sitting through four hours dining off sort of speech-sandwich, is that
you begin to get hungry again. The absent-minded man, offered an
ice, says he usually begins his dinner with soup. If two hundred
follow his example, and insist upon going all through the dinner
again, it is not only embarrassing, but becomes costly.</p>

<p><i>Off Jutland, Sunday.</i>&mdash;Don <span class="sc">Currie</span> last night gave return banquet
on <i>Tantallon Castle</i> to Hamburgers. Done in princely style. Over
two hundred sat down in brilliantly lighted saloon. Had our speeches, as usual with <i>nous
autres</i>, served with the dessert instead of as <i>entrées</i>. Few, short, pithy, and
one historical. Don <span class="sc">Currie</span> proposed toasts to his fellow Sovereigns, the
Queen of <span class="sc">England</span> and Emperor of <span class="sc">Germany</span>.
Burgomaster of Hamburg toasted Mr. G., who responded in speech, lofty in sentiment,
eloquently simple, admirable in delivery. Dog and pup, I have, during the last twenty
years, heard nearly every one of his great speeches in the House and out. Declare that in all
the qualities that go to make a perfect oration, it would be hard for even his record to
beat this impromptu speech, delivered amid such strange surroundings.</p>

<p>After dinner, a dance on deck. The waltzing and polkaing commonplace
enough. But pretty to see <span class="sc">John Leng, M.P.,</span> and
the <span class="sc">Lord of the Isles</span> do a sword
dance, whilst <span class="sc">Ramsay, M.P.,</span> like them, clad in national garb, played
the bagpipes. This struck the German guests more than anything.
Their papers full of it.</p>

<p><i>Copenhagen, Tuesday.</i>&mdash;King and Queen of <span class="sc">Denmark</span>, with rest of
Royal Family, had day out to-day. Came aboard <i>Tantallon Castle</i>
for luncheon.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[pg 305]</span></p>

<p>"You talk about your Roshervilles, <i>cher</i> <span class="sc">Tobee</span>," his Majesty
said,
as we smoked cigars with our coffee; "but to my mind, the place to
spend a happy day is the <i>Tantallon Castle</i>."</p>

<p>"There is," I said, "the drawback of the absence of shrimps. But
then even kings cannot have everything."</p>

<p>"True, <span class="sc">Tobee</span>," said the grandfather of our kings-to-be and of
other people's. And for a moment the royal brow was "sicklied
o'er with pale cast of thought."</p>

<p>It cleared as he caught sight of our two rival Kodakesses, who had
simultaneously got him in focus. Pretty to see King arrange his
hair, give little twist to moustache, and assume look of abstraction,
just as common people do when they suspect someone is taking a
snap-shot at them. As <span class="sc">Sark</span> says, "One snap of the Kodak makes
the whole world kin."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 360px;"><a href="images/305a-650.png"><img src="images/305a-360.png" width="360" height="472" alt="An admirable spot for a little quiet reading," /></a>
<p>An admirable spot for a little quiet reading,
although perhaps the firing does make it a leetle
difficult to concentrate one's thoughts wholly upon
the matter in hand.</p></div>

<p>Oddly enough, there were speeches at the luncheon. Mr. G.
having got his hand (or rather his voice) in at mouth of the Elbe,
delivered two charming addresses. One in proposing health of King
and Queen of <span class="sc">Denmark</span>, the other in responding to toast to his own
health, given by King. A new thing this for Old Parliamentary
Hand to serve as after-dinner speaker. Listening to his graceful,
gracious phrases, one almost regrets he should have given up so
much time to Irish Land Bills, Home Rule, and the like.</p>

<p>After luncheon a stroll on deck, and, incidentally, a memorable
scene. In addition to the Kodakesses, who have taken everyone on
board, except each other, we have a regular artist with a camera.
Don <span class="sc">Currie</span>, having a moment to spare, thought he would have his
likeness taken. Got into position; operator's head under the cloth
fixing him; in another moment it would have been done. As
<span class="sc">Shakspeare</span> wrote long ago, "Nothing escapes the eye of royal
Denmark." The King, seeing what was going on, quietly led up the
Queen, and stood by her in focus; the rest of the Royal Family, as
our toast lists have it, closed in, forming a group near the Don; and
when the astonished operator removed the cap and exposed the plate
he found upon it the Royal Family of Denmark and one simple Highland
gentleman distinguished in such company by his plain estate.</p>

<p>In afternoon, Don <span class="sc">Currie</span> having entertained Kings and Queens
and Crown Princes, threw open all the gangways of the ship to the
people of Copenhagen. They flocked in by hundreds, increasing to
thousands. In endless streams they passed along the decks peering
and poking their noses into every nook and cranny. On upper deck
they had a great find. Sitting in his state cabin, with door open,
was Mr. G. reading about the Vikings in their own tongue, which he has lately
added to his list of acquired foreign languages. The Danes, men, women, and
children, stood there at gaze. Mr. G., with his back turned to door, read on, unnoticing.
Crowd growing unmanageable with ever-increasing numbers, a handy quartermaster
rigged out ropes, and made sort of handrail, guarding either side of cabin, keeping
back crowd. But it filled the deck all through the afternoon, ever changing,
but ever one in its passionate, yet patient desire to catch a glimpse of that figure
in the cabin, that went on reading as if the world outside were a mere wilderness.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;At Kiel. Harbour and approaches filled with fleets
of all nations, every ship bristling with guns, and longing to be at
somebody. For the closing years of the nineteenth century of the
Christian Era, this is, as <span class="sc">Sark</span> says, most encouraging. It is the
completest achievement, the proudest thing civilisation has to show us.</p>

<h3>THE LEADING MOTIVE OF THE "W. O.," WITH VARIATIONS.</h3>

<p><i>The General Idea</i> (<i>supplied at Pall Mall</i>). That, although the
British Army costs (exclusive of extras) £57 per man, the War
Office is the best <i>bureau</i> in the world. The establishments over
which the Secretary of State and the Commander-in-Chief preside,
are necessarily incapable of improvement, as they are absolutely
perfect. This being so, nothing more need, can, and should be said.</p>

<p><i>Commentary No. 1</i> (<i>supplied by Printing House Square</i>). That
the General Idea of the War Office is ridiculous. That were Pall
Mall to be occupied by the staff of a merchant's office, the nation
would be saved millions, and the £57 (exclusive of extras) per man
arrangement would soon be regarded as an extravagant product of
the wasteful past.</p>

<p><i>Commentary No. 2</i> (<i>supplied by a military writer</i>). That civilians
cannot possibly know anything about the working of a
Government Office. As Pall Mall says it is perfect, it is to be presumed
that it is. Why not leave well alone? And as for £57 (exclusive
of extras) per man, why, is not that arrangement less than £60?</p>

<p><i>Commentary No. 3</i> (<i>supplied anonymously</i>). Opinion of military
writer not worth the paper containing it. Look abroad. Does the
foreign service cost £57 per man, exclusive of extras? Not at all.
Then what can be done on the Continent, can, and should be done in
England.</p>

<p><i>Commentary No. 4</i> (<i>supplied by the working-classes</i>). What! pay,
£57 (exclusive of extras) for a soldier? Much better abolish the
Army, and reduce the price of beer!</p>

<p><i>Commentary No. 5 and last</i> (<i>supplied by</i> Private <span class="sc">Thomas
Atkins</span>).
What, I cost £57 a year, exclusive of extras! Well, all I can say
is, that precious little of the money or the perquisites gets into <i>my</i>
pockets! Worse luck to it!</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">President</span> of the French Republic having thought that it
would be a pleasing compliment to Russia if some specimens of
Russian architecture could be erected in Paris, it is believed that the
<i>Commission des Monuments Historiques</i> will cover the Louvre with
laths and canvas, painted to represent the Kremlin, and by similar
means will transform the Champs Elysées into the Nevsky Prospect,
and will give to Notre Dame the appearance of the forts at Cronstadt.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Khedive</span> has expressed an opinion that the Pyramids look old
and shabby. If the English and French government will authorise
the expenditure, the whole surface of the stone will be made perfectly
smooth, will be painted and grained in imitation of oak, and will
finally be varnished. The face of the Sphinx will be washed, and will
then be used for an advertisement of an English soap. The enormous
rent paid for this will be added to the <span class="sc">Khedive's</span> pocket money.</p>

<p>The Queen of <span class="sc">Holland</span> is dissatisfied with the flat surroundings of
the Hague. It has been pointed out to <span class="sc">Her Majesty</span> that the city
contains a hill, called, we believe, the Vijverberg, which rises at
least three feet above the level of the sea, but she has replied that
this is not enough. It is therefore proposed to surround the whole
city with a gigantic panorama of the Bernese Oberland.</p>

<p>The other day the King of <span class="sc">Spain</span> perceived a reflection of the moon
in a pond, and was much annoyed when his attendants failed to bring
it to him. It has now been arranged that all the ponds in the neighbourhood
shall contain an aluminium moon, which can be pulled out
by a specially appointed Grandee of Spain, if commanded by <span class="sc">His

<p>The Witness Protection Society and General Legal Reform Union

objects of this estimable body the chief appears to be to protect witnesses
in law courts from insult by counsel. Captain <span class="sc">Parkis</span>, having
expressed himself as willing, was voted to the chair, and the members
settled down to have a good time. "Heated discussion,"
"further disturbance," and a well-sustained fire of "protests," lent
an air of gaiety to the proceedings, which culminated in "various
gentlemen abusing one another across the table." With such excellent
practice, the members of the W. P. S. G. L. R. U. should be
able to hold their own in court. The Bar trembles. Even the Bench

<p class="ind">When I was a freshman at Cambridge (<i>eheu fugaces!</i>) I remember
being both impressed and terrified at having pointed out to me
a tutor of a certain College who was said to be the hero of a Bacchanalian
incident. The story went that the tutor, returning from
some feast with a party of friends, fell, by mischance, into one of the
narrow streams of water that flow at the side of the Cambridge
streets. Striking out vigorously, he shouted, "Save the rest, I can
swim." No doubt the story is still told, for the supposed hero of it
is still alive. Indeed, when a caricature of him was published some
years ago in <i>Vanity Fair</i>, the biography by <span class="sc">Jehu Junior</span> closed
with the words, "He can swim." Yet the story, as affecting
Mr. <span class="sc">Dash</span>, of Blank College, is manifestly false, for it is older than
the century. The curious may find it in its original form in the
lately published volume of <span class="sc">S. T. Coleridge's</span> letters. The poet
relates it of an undergraduate of his day who had taken part in a
drunken revel.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p class="ind">But the ways of stories are at all times inscrutable. I have
myself&mdash;I confess it without a blush&mdash;deliberately invented and
spread abroad a story about a semi-public dinner. I did so merely
because it struck me as containing elements of humour. Besides, it
not only might have happened, but ought to have happened. A year
or two later six gentlemen, who had been present when the incident
did not occur, related it back to me, each one with a little special
embellishment of his own. Some of them were magistrates, most of
them were fathers of families, and all were honourable men. Yet
they were all prepared to stake their reputations on the absolute
veracity of this myth; and, what is even more curious, they retailed
it to its inventor and disseminator.</p>

<p class="ind">Lytham is troubled. I read that "the musical attractions at the
Pier Pavilion have been fairly patronised, and dancing on the pier is
to be resumed." This latter attraction, it appears, has not met with
the entire approval of the Lytham people, who contend that it will
bring Lytham into disrepute. "The Ratepayers' Association have had
the matter under consideration, and have disclaimed any connection
with the innovation. The directors, however, have had the question
under discussion, and have decided to continue the dancing."</p>

<div class="poem width30">  <div class="stanza">

<p>As the rest of them are doing, in your gay <i>al fresco</i> dance."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">

<p class="ind">I note from a correspondence in <i>The Scotsman</i> that a considerable
amount of feeling has been aroused by the erection of the new North
British Railway Hotel in Princes Street. Lord <span class="sc">Wemyss</span>, apparently,
has declared not only that it will spoil the view, but also that it will
"pierce the vault of heaven." Another correspondent adds that it
will have "a Jennerised, unreposeful front." That ought to settle
the matter at once. Someone else complains of "those terrible
advertisements of drugs and fluid beef which extend in gigantic
letters along the side of the lower part of the Carlton Hill, and which
catch the unwilling eye of anyone looking from the Bridges, from the
Mound, and indeed from any part of the Old Town." What with
advertisements of drugs and fluid beef, and a new hotel possessing a
Jennerised, unreposeful front, obviously Edinburgh is in a bad way.</p>

"how a member of the Church of England can be expected to make
the slightest sacrifice (except on the principle of Christian charity),
seeing that the whole idea of the 'Liberator' scheme was to find
funds for the agitators whose sole aim was the robbery and destruction
of the Church of England as a national institution, and to get
hold of its funds for secular and non-religious purposes." Dear me,
dear me, how strange, how terrible, how muddle-headed. This poor
politician has evidently got mixed up between the Liberator and the
"Liberation Society." Let him take the hint, and send in his

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p><i>The Convict Ship</i>, <span class="sc">Clark Russel's</span> latest novel (<span class="sc">Chatto and
Windus</span>), is redolent of the sea. There is no writer, not forgetting
<span class="sc">Marryat</span>, who has such close companionship with the sea in its
multiple forms and its many moods. The temptation to transfer
some of the ever-varying pictures of the
sea which sparkle in these pages is great
but must be resisted. Here is a glimpse of
night at sea, chosen not because it is best,
but because it is shortest:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;"><a href="images/309b-380.png"><img src="images/309b-150.png" width="150" height="219" alt="Lookout" /></a></div>

<p class="ind3">"The mighty shadow of the ocean night was
majestic and awful, with the wild, flashful
colouring of lightning in the south, and the
dustlike multitude of stars over the three
glooming spires of our ship."</p>

<p>One would suppose that, sitting down to
write, <span class="sc">Clark Russell</span> had just come home
from a long trip foreign, or at least lived his
life somewhere within sight and sound of
the sea. The pity of it is, my Baronite
tells me, that this incomparable student of
the sea, of ships that go down upon the
waters, and of those who people them, lies
at anchor on his sofa in an inland town. He has not looked upon
the sea for a dozen years, nor smelt its brine, nor watched a ship
coming or going. This makes the more marvellous the power of
description of sea life in all its forms here displayed. Beyond this
special gift, fascinating to some people, Mr. <span class="sc">Russell</span> has a story
to tell, a good stout sea story, full of life and adventure, through
the devious movements of which we meet real men and one woman.
Remembering that <span class="sc">Clark Russell</span> now ranks as a veteran novelist,
it is pleasant to bear testimony to the fact that he seems to have saved
his best wine to the last. <i>The Convict Ship</i> is, take it from stem to
stern, the best work he has yet turned out.</p>

<p>"N.B."&mdash;Glasgow will have to look after its parks. Here is the
Town Council actually dreaming of "feuing" some of "the recently-acquired
Camphill grounds" for building purposes! These grounds
belong to the people, and adjoin the South Side Park, and "the
amenity of that park would be destroyed" by building operations.
One protester says South Side Park is the prettiest in Glasgow, and
"more like the London parks, which I regard as the finest in the
kingdom." Thanks, worthy Scot! The view of it, "as seen
through the railings in the Pollokshaws Road," reminds him of
"the fine view of Hyde Park which is to be had through the railing
in that busy and lovely thoroughfare&mdash;Oxford Street." Thanks
again, thrice worthy Pict! But Oxford Street a "lovely thoroughfare"&mdash;well!
At any rate, the Glasgow Bailies when next they are
disposed to "feu," should think of the "Many" instead.</p>

<p><i>Miss Prunes-Prism.</i> And now, my dear charges, I trust you have
utilised the hour that has been hypothecated to enjoyment profitably.</p>

<p><i>Emily.</i> Indeed we have, dear governess. I have read to my
brother and sister a most amusing account of a railway traveller who
wished to get from Bangor to Euston in five hours, and was baffled
in the well-intentioned attempt by the clever ingenuity of the railway
companies!</p>

<p><i>Miss Prunes-Prism.</i> You refer, no doubt, to the gentleman who,
having left Bangor at 7.55, reached Llandudno at 8.5, Colwyn Bay
at 8.41, Abergele at 8.52, Rhyl at 9.2, and Chester at 9.56.</p>

<p><i>Margaret.</i> Yes, dear Miss <span class="sc">Prunes-Prism</span>; and it is at that point
the fun of the railway companies came in. Having arrived at 9.56
he found that the train for London had already left. It was timed
to depart for the metropolis exactly one minute before the arrival of
his train at 9.55!</p>

<p><i>Emily.</i> Indeed, dear governess, the story is vastly entertaining.
Then there is a similar arrangement at Crewe Junction. At that
centre of popularity a train arrives from a provincial source at 10.48,
just one minute later than the advertised time for the departure of
the London train. Those who have the framing of these traffic
arrangements must be wags of the first water!</p>

<p><i>Miss Prunes-Prism.</i> No doubt they are. And now, my dear
<span class="sc">Charles</span>, supposing your dear papa wished to get from Bangor to
Euston, what would you advise him to do?</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> I should recommend him to walk.</p>
